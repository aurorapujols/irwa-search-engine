      This repository contains the code for the IRWA Final Project - Search Engine with Web Analytics.
      The project is implemented using Python and the Flask web framework. It includes a simple web application that allows users to search through a collection of documents and view analytics about their searches.

## To download this repo locally

Open a terminal console and execute:
```
cd <your preferred projects root directory>
git clone https://github.com/trokhymovych/irwa-search-engine.git
```

### Setting up the Python environment (only for the first time you run the project)
### Install virtualenv
Setting up a virtualenv is recommended to isolate the project dependencies from other Python projects on your machine.
It allows you to manage packages on a per-project basis, avoiding potential conflicts between different projects.

In the project root directory execute:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv --version
```

### Prepare virtualenv for the project
In the root of the project folder run to create a virtualenv named `irwa_venv`:
```bash
virtualenv irwa_venv
```

If you list the contents of the project root directory, you will see that it has created a new folder named `irwa_venv` that contains the virtualenv:
```bash
ls -l
```

The next step is to activate your new virtualenv for the project:
```bash
source irwa_venv/bin/activate
```

or for Windows...
```cmd
irwa_venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

This will load the python virtualenv for the project.

### Installing Flask and other packages in your virtualenv
Make sure you are in the root of the project folder and that your virtualenv is activated (you should see `(irwa_venv)` in your terminal prompt).
And then install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt` with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to add more packages in the future, you can install them with pip and then update `requirements.txt` with:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Enjoy!


### Starting the Web App
```bash
python -V
# Make sure we use Python 3

cd search-engine-web-app
python web_app.py
```
The above will start a web server with the application:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'web-app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8088/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open Web app in your Browser:  
[http://127.0.0.1:8088/](http://127.0.0.1:8088/) or [http://localhost:8088/](http://localhost:8088/)
